        <h1>Guts' Bio</h1>


        <p>
            Guts (Japanese: ガッツ, Hepburn: Gattsu, sometimes romanized as Güts) is the protagonist from the manga Berserk
            by Kentaro Miura. Guts is a mercenary who travels from company to company and companionship to
            companionship. After meeting Griffith, Guts is defeated in battle by Griffith and is forced to join the Band
            of the Hawk as the latter proclaims he now "owns" him. The dynamic and turbulent relationship between Guts
            and Griffith, the leader of the Band of the Hawk, forms the primary focus of the manga. After the events of
            the Eclipse, during which he loses his left forearm and right eye, Guts seeks revenge on Griffith.

        <p>
            The character has also appeared in the animated adaptations of Berserk as well as video games with multiple
            voice actors. Miura conceptualized Guts' character while they were an assistant to George Morikawa. He
            mentions multiple influences including Fist of the North Star, Dororo, Mad Max, Conan the Barbarian, among
            others.

        <p>
            Critical response to Guts has been highly positive. Guts has been praised for the themes he embodies as a
            result of his tragic backstory and how he becomes an anti-hero in the process, to the point of being of one
            of the most iconic characters in manga and anime.

        <h1>Guts' Theme</h1>

        <p>
            Susumu Hirasawa has composed the soundtracks for both the anime and video games, using an eclectic selection
            of instruments (such as piano, bagpipes, violin, harp, flute, classic guitar, electric guitar, drums,
            harpsichord, synthesizer, and Amiga as well as voices). He received the offer to compose music for the
            series due to Miura being a fan of his works and listening to them while he works on Berserk, that also led
            to Miura almost never requesting a specific composition to Hirasawa. Hirasawa has said that Berserk doesn't
            feel like a self-restrained story, and that composing for the series is similar to the sensation of
            unlocking one of his inner restraints, leading to compositions on a "Berserk" style.

            On October 14th, 1997, episode two "The Band of the Hawk" of the 1997 anime adaptation of the Berserk manga
            series premiered. In the episode, the main protagonist of the series Guts talks to the leader of the
            mercenary group Band of the Hawk Griffith, who invites him to join his group as a soldier. During the
            dialogue, the soundtrack composition "Guts" ("Gatsu"), plays for the first time
