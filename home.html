        <p style="color: white; text-align: justify; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro
            Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a
            lone mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". Miura premiered
            a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine
            Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk has
            continued its publication intermittently. Following Miura's death in May 2021, the final chapter that he
            wrote and illustrated was published posthumously. The series is set to resume publication in June 2022,
            under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori and Miura's group of
            assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.

            Berserk was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series by OLM, which covered the Golden Age story
            arc, and was broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998. The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a trilogy
            of theatrical anime films; the first two films premiered in 2012 and the third film premiered in 2013. A
            second 24-episode anime television series adaptation was broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.

        <p style="color: white; text-align: justify; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            As of May 2021, the Berserk manga had over 50 million copies in circulation, including digital versions,
            making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It received the Award for Excellence at the 6th
            installment of the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002. Berserk has been widely acclaimed, particularly for
            its dark setting, storytelling, characters, and Miura's detailed artwork.
