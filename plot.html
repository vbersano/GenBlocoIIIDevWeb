        <p>
            Guts is a lone warrior who was born from a hanged corpse and raised as a mercenary by adoptive father
            Gambino, whom he was forced to kill in self defense. His fearsome reputation catches the attention of
            Griffith, the charismatic leader of a mercenary group known as the Band of the Hawk. Griffith forces Guts to
            join the group after defeating him in battle, with Guts becoming his best fighter while quickly rising
            through the band's ranks as they are hired by the kingdom of Midland during its century-long war against the
            Chuder Empire. Guts would later learn of Griffith's desire to rule a kingdom of his own and his mysterious
            pendant known as a Behelit, which was instrumental when they were spared by Nosferatu Zodd, a monstrous
            immortal who leaves Guts with a cryptic warning of a painful demise for being Griffith's friend.
        </p>

        <p>
            As Griffith begins to mingle with Midland nobility and acquaint himself with the king's daughter Charlotte,
            Guts began developing feelings for his fellow commander Casca, the Hawks' only female member. But when Guts
            overhears Griffith confessing to Charlotte that he considers someone with their own dream a friend, Guts
            decides to leave the group once Midland has won its war. However, once Guts departs the Band of the Hawk,
            this devastates Griffith. Emotionally distraught, Griffith seduces Charlotte, resulting in his arrest and
            torture while the Hawks are branded criminals by the Midland army. Guts spends the next year training to
            become a better swordsman, but is warned by a mysterious being he names "the Skull Knight" that his actions
            have instigated an "Eclipse". Guts learns of the Hawks' predicament and rejoins them to rescue Griffith
            while consummating his feelings for Casca.
        </p>

        <p>
            The group soon end up on a crossroads upon learning Griffith has become disabled and mute after a year of
            intense and continuous torture. While making for Midland's borders, Griffith regains his Behelit at his
            moment of despair over his condition during a solar eclipse. The item transports the Hawks to another
            dimension where they encounter four archdemons collectively known as the "Godhand", who have gathered for an
            event known as the Eclipse where Griffith will sacrifice his comrades and transcend his humanity to join
            them as their fifth member. Griffith willingly accepts once reminded of the ambitious man he has always
            been, with the Hawks branded with a demonic sigil and slaughtered by the Godhand's "apostles" â€” humans like
            Zodd who sacrificed their loved ones and humanity for power. Only Guts and Casca survive while Griffith is
            reborn as the Godhand's fifth and final member "Femto", raping Casca while Guts loses his right eye and left
            forearm in his attempt to save her before they are rescued by the Skull Knight. However, the ordeal
            traumatizes Casca, causing her to regress to a childlike state. Guts learns from the Skull Knight that their
            "Brands of Sacrifice" leave them open to be preyed upon by supernatural creatures. Guts leaves Casca in the
            care of the blacksmith Godo, his adoptive daughter Erica and Rickert, the youngest member of the Band of the
            Hawk who survived by not being present at the Eclipse. With a new sword named Dragon Slayer and a prosthetic
            left arm with a built-in cannon and crossbow, Guts begins hunting down apostles in search of revenge on
            Griffith. During this time, Guts is followed by his unborn child with Casca, deformed into a demonic phantom
            as a result of Femto's rape (dubbed the Demon Child).

        <p>
            Two years later, after having killed many apostles and earning the nickname of "the Black Swordsman", Guts
            is joined by an elf named Puck and is also captured by Farnese, captain of the Holy See Church's Holy Iron
            Chain Knights, and her bodyguard Serpico who were sent after him, believing he is a harbinger of the
            apocalypse. He manages to escape after saving Farnese from demonic entities before returning to Godo where
            he learns that Casca has disappeared. Guts' search for her takes him to the city of St. Albion, learning the
            Godhand arranged for the city, now home to thousands of refugees, as the site for an Incarnation ceremony to
            give one of their own a physical form. Guts saves Casca from the fanatical Holy See bishop Mozgus as the
            city descends into nightmarish chaos from the souls of the dead attacking. Joined by Farnese, Serpico and a
            young thief named Isidro, Guts and Casca survive the ordeal as Griffith reconstitutes through a misshapen
            apostle desiring to "hatch" a new world who ingested the dying Demon Child prior.

        <p>

            Guts' group later encounter the witch Flora during an attempt to save a village from marauding trolls, and
            her apprentice Schierke, who begins to teach Farnese magic and negates the effects of the brand on Guts and
            Casca. Prior to her death when members of the New Band of the Hawk destroy the tree she made her home it,
            Flora gives Guts use of a dangerous relic known as the Berserker Armour which increases his physical
            ability, but increases the risk of being consumed by his inner darkness. While Guts and his party secure a
            ship to reach Elfhelm in, Griffith's war with Ganishka climaxes when the emperor's destruction following his
            transition into a god-like abomination causes an overlapping of the mortal realm and the supernatural astral
            realm. Unopposed and with Charlotte and the Holy See's blessing, Griffith establishes the city of Falconia
            to provide refuge for Midlanders and the rest of humanity from the numerous mythical creatures that
            manifested in the realms' overlapping.
        </p>

        <p>
            Guts later encounters Griffith and Zodd at Godo's home with his battle with the latter destroying the
            enchanted mine that kept Casca safe while Griffith realizes some lingering traces of the Demon Child persist
            within him. Guts decides to take Casca to Puck's homeland of Elfhelm on the island of Skellig to see if
            there is a means of restoring her mind, allowing Isidro, Farnese and Serpico to follow him as he fears
            losing control of himself to his dark impulses, embodied as a demonic black dog within his mind. At the same
            time, Griffith creates a second Band of the Hawk with Zodd and other apostles among its ranks to save
            Midland from the invading Kushan Empire, led by their rogue Apostle emperor, Ganishka.

            At the same time, following a dramatic battle with a supernatural island-sized monster known as the Sea God
            and recruiting one of the islanders, a merrow girl called Isma, Guts' party reaches Elfhelm. The elf ruler,
            Danann, helps Farnese and Schierke travel into Casca's mind and restore her to her former self. But despite
            her recovery, Casca was still traumatized from her ordeal, making it difficult to be around Guts without
            having a flashback. Farnese and Schierke later begin training with the other apprentice witches and wizards
            living on Skellig, the former taking an interest in the power to heal human souls to help Casca. At the same
            time, Guts encounters the Skull Knight once again who tells him that his journey is at an end, guiding him
            to the creator of the Berserker Armour and teaching Guts about his own past with the God Hand. Meanwhile,
            after defeating an army of giants, Griffith participates in a council with the other nobles of Falconia
            before departing that evening. Guts is then met by the Moonlight Boy, a mysterious child-looking entity who
            had appeared before the group beforehand on their journey to Elfhelm. Danann detects no malice from the Boy,
            and he is allowed to stay, forming a bond akin to mother and son with Casca. The latest chapter ends with
            the revelation that the Moonlight Boy shares a body with Griffith who appears before Guts and Casca with a
            single tear rolling down his face.
